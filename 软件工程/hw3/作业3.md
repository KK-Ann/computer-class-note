If the test fails, ATM goes into Out of Service state, otherwise there is triggerless transition to the Idle state. In this state ATM waits for customer interaction.

Note, that transition from Serving Customer state back to the Idle state could be triggered by cancel event as the customer could cancel transaction at any time
